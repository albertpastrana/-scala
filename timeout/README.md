# Timeout [![bintray](https://api.bintray.com/packages/albertpastrana/maven/uscala-timeout/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/albertpastrana/maven/uscala-timeout/_latestVersion)

A small utility that allows to query if a specific amount of time has
elapsed or not.

As an example, it can be useful when some polling mechanism
is needed to verify if an operation is successful or not.

It can also be used as a replacement for a stopwatch, if the
only thing you need is to check the time elapsed every so on.
